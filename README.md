# 📘 Quantitative Finance Practice

This repository is a curated collection of **quantitative finance models and techniques** implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebooks. These notebooks were developed as part of my self-study and hands-on practice during the **Certificate in Quantitative Finance (CQF)** program. They cover key financial theories, pricing models, statistical techniques, and optimization methods, with a focus on practicality and intuition.
