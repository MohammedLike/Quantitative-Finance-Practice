# 📘 Quantitative Finance Practice

This repository contains practical Jupyter Notebooks created during my learning journey through the **Certificate in Quantitative Finance (CQF)** and self-study. Each notebook explores a specific concept or model commonly used in quantitative finance, financial engineering, or asset pricing.

> 🧠 This is a learning-focused repo – most notebooks are early implementations of fundamental models.

## 🗂️ Contents

### 📌 Asset Pricing & Financial Models

- **`APT.ipynb`**  
  Implements the **Arbitrage Pricing Theory**, a multi-factor asset pricing model extending CAPM. Includes factor sensitivity calculations and linear factor structure examples.

- **`CAPM.ipynb`**  
  Demonstrates the **Capital Asset Pricing Model**, calculating expected returns using beta, market return, and risk-free rate. Also includes plotting of the Security Market Line (SML).

- **`Fama French.ipynb`**  
  Applies the **Fama-French 3-Factor Model**, analyzing stock returns using SMB (size), HML (value), and market factors. Includes basic regression analysis and interpretation.

- **`carhart.ipynb`**  
  Adds momentum to Fama-French factors using the **Carhart 4-Factor Model**, expanding factor-based asset pricing by incorporating return continuation.

### 📊 Quantitative Models & Techniques

- **`LinearRegression.ipynb`**  
  Basic **OLS regression** on financial data, including t-stats, R², p-values, and interpretation. Serves as a foundation for factor model implementations.

- **`vasicek model.ipynb`**  
  Implements the **Vasicek interest rate model**, simulating mean-reverting rates and calculating zero-coupon bond prices using closed-form solutions.

---

### 🧮 Derivatives & Option Pricing

- **`One Period Binomial tree.ipynb`**  
  A simple one-period binomial model for pricing European options. Uses risk-neutral valuation and replicating portfolio logic.

- **`modules1.ipynb`**  
  Contains extensions into **multi-period binomial trees**, with emphasis on up/down factors, option valuation paths, and convergence to Black-Scholes.

---

### 📈 Portfolio Theory & Optimization

- **`MPT.ipynb`**  
  Covers **Modern Portfolio Theory (Markowitz)** – efficient frontier construction, portfolio variance minimization, and Sharpe ratio maximization.

- **`Optimization.ipynb`**  
  Explores portfolio optimization using **numerical techniques** (e.g. `scipy.optimize`) to achieve desired risk-return characteristics.

---

### 🧪 CQF Specific Practice

- **`CQF Practical.ipynb`**  
  A miscellaneous notebook with various CQF-aligned exercises including model simulations, pricing logic, and math-heavy explorations.

- **`Notebook.ipynb`**  
  A general sandbox for practice — may include code testing, debugging, or ad-hoc computations related to CQF concepts.
